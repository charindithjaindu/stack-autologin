# Autologin to StackOverflow

So, you want to get a [Fanatic][fanatic-badge] badge on StackOverflow? But it's not very easy not to forget to login on it every day 100 times. Especially when you are on your vacation.. I had a 86-in-line :( and it was my third try.

Just schedule this [Selenium][selenium] test with cron and get your badge!
